				<p>I spent the first eighteen years in China. I've always been wanted to experience a
				different culture. I decided to come to United States to continue my study. I went to Houston Community College
				first. I stayed there for three years and got an associate degree in science. Then I transfer to Texas A&M University studying 
				computer engineering. Before I picked my major, I was really struggling. I wanted to do something creative.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="column">
				<p> First, I was thinking about design, but my parents think it is hard to find a job. Then I thought about engineering, 
				it is something that includes creativity. The reason why I chose computer engineering is that I think there is still a lot more that 
				we can explore in this field. There is still a lot more technologes that have not been descovered. The only issue was that I was not sure 
				what speciality that I want to go with. I wanted to do game development first, but then I found it was very specific and the requirement is really high.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="column">
				<p> I did not find that out until I graduated. Then I found web development is very interesting. I did not have any background with web development whatsoever. 
				Then we have to move to Florida, that is why I am taking classes at Valencia College. Also, I am doing self-teaching as well. I decided to make some personaly projects first 
				to gain more experience.</p>
